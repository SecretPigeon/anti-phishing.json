> Proposal to close email security gaps enabling phishing by use of a well-known URI

## Premise
It's my observation that people see the following categories of email in their inbox's:-
 * Person to Person (Emails from freinds and colleagues)
 * Unsolicited Business to Person (Spam)
 * Solicited Business to Person (Online banking, Website signups)

And it's my posistion, that the 3rd case "Solicited Business to Person" is at the biggest risk of phishing. That is because this category includes our finincial interactions, our social media accounts and any interactions with websites that could result in account comprimise.
