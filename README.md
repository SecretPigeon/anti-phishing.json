> Proposal to close email security gaps enabling phishing by use of a well-known URI

## Premise
It's my observation that people see the following categories of email in their inbox's:-
 * Person to Person (Emails from freinds and colleagues)
 * Unsolicited Organisation to Person (Spam)
 * Solicited Organisation to Person (Online banking, Website signups)

And it's my posistion, that the 3rd case "Solicited Organisation to Person" is at the biggest risk of phishing. That is because this category includes our finincial interactions, our social media accounts and any interactions with websites that could result in account comprimise.

Although email between Organisations and users is not considered a secure channel. There does exist a well establish channel that is considered secure by most end users, organsiations and experts; that being websites. A website with TLS and a CA signed certificate, is already consider sufficently secure for online banking, payments, taxes and government services. Most buisness to user communications are simply links bank to the website that a user signed up to or has an existing relationship with.
